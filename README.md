In this project, I aim to develop a classifier capable of distinguishing between two music genres—hip-hop and rock—using a dataset composed of songs from these genres. 
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, providing a comprehensive collection of tracks. 
Initially, I will employ Python's pandas and seaborn packages to subset the data, aggregate the information, and create visualizations to explore evident trends and factors. 
The goal is to analyze the dataset thoroughly and use machine learning techniques to build an effective classification model. 
Subsequently, I will utilize the “scikit-learn” package to predict the genre of a song by analyzing features such as danceability, energy, acoustics, and tempo. 
This process will involve reviewing and implementing common algorithms, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), logistic regression, and decision trees.
